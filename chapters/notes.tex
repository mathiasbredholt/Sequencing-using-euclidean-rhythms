% Choice based HCI
% In stark contrast to the commonly accepted choice-based nature of many computer interfaces are the control interfaces for musical instruments and vehicles, where the human operator is totally in charge of the action. Many parameters are controlled simultaneously and the human operator has an overall view of what the system is doing. Feedback is gained not by on-screen prompts, but by experiencing the moment-by-moment effect of each action with the whole body.
