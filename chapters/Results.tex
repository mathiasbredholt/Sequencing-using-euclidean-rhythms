\section{Measurement of timing accuracy}
This section presents and analyses results on the sequencer's timing precision i.e its ability to execute rhythmic events at the correct time. According to the \cref{req:time} the  precision, $\sigma$ should be of 96 parts per quarter note. 255 BPM is used for the calculation of this required precision, as it is the maximum tempo, and thereby a worst-case-estimate.\\
$$\sigma = (\frac{255*4}{60})^{-1} *\frac{1}{4} =  \SI{2.5}{\milli\second}$$
In order to evaluate the precision of the timing, a set of predicted values are generated. These are calculated from the linear model \cref{eq:steptimecalc}, for a given BPM, exactly as in the implementation , and are thereby equal to the timestamps of scheduled events on the sequencer. \\

For the matter of timing, small fluctuations that fall under what is perceivable are allowed,\cref{sec:design_requirements} and these will not accumulate, as the sequencer is resynchronized every 4 step, when the buffer is refilled.\\
Thus, it is important to put more weight on outliers, large errors, and therefore the \textit{Root Mean Square Error} (RMSE) is used as a measure of the timing accuracy. \\
It is expected to see a positive but small correlation between BPM and RMSE, as more events are scheduled, and calculations are done more often. 

\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:exp_setup}
The sequencer is connected to a laptop through USB. The sequencer is setup to play sixteenth notes, $E(8,8)$, with no groove applied.\\
Incoming midi messages(NoteOn only) is captured using the RT-midi library by Gary Scavone\footnote{\url{http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/}},and a time measure with \SI{}{\micro\second} resolution is logged.\\
A sweep from 80 to 255 BPM in steps of 5 BPM is made, capturing 20 data points for each instance. \\
This is implemented in the python script \cref{lst:pythonscript}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python script to log timing of incoming midi messages with the RT-midi library, and calculate RMSE },label={lst:pythonscript}]
import rtmidi
import time
import numpy as np
import sys

m = rtmidi.MidiIn()
m.open_port(3)

N = 20 # Number of datapoints

d = np.zeros(N) # init array to hold time values

i = 0
while i < N:
	msg = m.get_message()
	if msg is not None:
		if msg[0][0] == 144: # if NoteOn
			d[i] = time.time()
			i = i + 1

# Remove offsett to avoid floating point underflow RMSE calculation 
d = d - d[0]

# Calulate predicted values
bpm = int(sys.argv[1])
step = 60 / (bpm * 4)
d_t = np.arange(0, step * N, step)

# Calculate RMSE
rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.power(d_t[0:N] - d, 2))) 

print(bpm, rmse)
del m

\end{lstlisting}

    \label{fig:RMSE}
\end{figure}

As shown in \cref{fig:RMSE}, the RMSE on timing is below $\SI{2.5}{\milli\second}$, within the range of $[40;255]$ BPM. Worst case is a peak of 1.2 ms at 160 BPM. The plot shows a noisy relation between BPM and RMSE, and the corresponding correlation index is -0.3\\

% To further analyze this behaviour, a set of measurements under almost same conditions as described in \cref{sec:exp_setup} is made, only now the frequently orcurring I2c the request(every 25 ms), for updating user interface is disabled.  
% The result, when averaging over 20 datapoints at 160 BPM is $RMSE = $ 

\section{Measurement of groove system}
\label{sec:groove_results}
This sections presents an analyzes results from a test setup that measures the expressive timing and accentuation introduced by the groove system.\\ The groove used for the test setup 16 steps long (16th. notes) and has a velocity pattern of an a \textit{agogo} groove from the Ableton Live library. The timing of the groove is 16th. notes swing, which means that every second onset is delayed by half its value, a 32th. note in this case. See \cref{fig:swing} \\
The euclidean rhythm $E(12,7)$ is used for the tesp - a common west African African bell pattern. \cite{Toussaint2005TheEA}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{graphics/swing.pdf}
    \caption{1/16 swing rhythm}
    \label{fig:swing}
\end{figure}

\cref{tab:param_groove} shows the parameter values for the test setup. As the timing parameter is 25, a 25 \% swing is expected, implying a maximum onset displacement of: 
$$\Delta t <= (\frac{BPM*4}{60})^{-1} \cdot \frac{1}{32} \cdot 25 \% = \SI{15.6}{\milli\second}$$


\begin{table}[]

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Parameters for groove test. Excluded parameters have default values and insignificant for the test data. }
    \label{tab:param_groove}
\end{table}

The test setup is equal to that of \cref{sec:exp_setup}, and the python script in \cref{lst:pythongroove} is used to capture incoming midi note-on messages, and log the velocity along with a timestamp. 
The results are shown in \cref{fig:groove_result}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python script for groove test}, label={lst:pythongroove}]
import rtmidi
import time
import numpy as np
import sys

m = rtmidi.MidiIn()
m.open_port(3)

while True:
	msg = m.get_message()
	if msg is not None:
		if msg[0][0] == 144:
			print(time.time(), msg[0][2])

del m
\end{lstlisting}

    \label{fig:groove_result}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:groove_result} shows how the velocity of the pulses has been altered by the groove, from a static value of 100, to dynamic variations in the range $[50;115]$. The velocity of steps 3 and 8, is repeated in steps 19 and 24, which is a result of the 16 step velocity periodicity, corresponding to the "Groove length". \\

he effect on the timing is seen at the zoom plot, which shows the maximum displacement of $\SI{18.1}{\milli\second}$. This is is $\SI{2.5}{\milli\second}$ more than expected, though within the limits of \cref{req:time}. 

\section{Evaluation of User experience}

In late November 2017, 26 test persons were given a 10 mine session for trying the sequencer, with a short introduction to the layout of the parameters. After this they were asked to fill out a survey with 4 questions. This section summarizes the results. 

In \cref{fig:questions} the 4 questions is presented. They are all measures of self-assessment regarding the experience with the sequencer, on a 5 point linear scale from \textit{"strongly disagree"} to \textit{"strongly agree"}. Additionally the test persons had the opportunity of giving qualitative comments on the groove system, as well as an overall comment for critique/ideas for improvement. \\

\begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{factbox}
        \textbf{Q1} \textit{"I am very experienced with composing electronic music?"}
        \\\\
        \textbf{Q2} \textit{"I was familiar with euclidean rhythms before trying testing sequencer"}
        \\\\
        \textbf{Q3} \textit{"I am familiar with euclidean rhythms now"}
        \\\\
        % \textbf{Q4}\textit{"The groove parameters, makes a meaningful addition to euclidean rhythms"}
        % \\\\
        \textbf{Q4} \textit{"I learned programming the sequencer, during the 10 minutes given."}

    \end{factbox}
    \caption{Questions on user-experience. Answered by 26 test persons.}
    \label{fig:questions}
\end{figure}
The results is visualized in \cref{fig:hist_q4,fig:boxplot,fig:corr}.

 \cref{fig:hist_q4} shows all test persons had a feeling of learning to program the sequencer during 10 minutes of testing, disregarding their self assessed level of experience with electronic music.\\
69.2 \% answered \textit{"strongly agree"} and 30.2 \% answered \textit{"agree"}.\\ \cref{fig:corr}, shows that their is no significant correlation between these answers, and their rating of musical experience. \\
On the contrary, \cref{fig:corr} shows a correlation between their subjective understanding of euclidean rhythms, and the their musical experience.

\end{figure}

The answers to questions \textit{Q2} and \textit{Q3} about euclidean rhythms, is visualized in \cref{fig:boxplot}. The median is moved upwards, towards a greater understanding of euclidean rhythms, which shows that the majority of test person felt they gained a better understanding of euclidean rhythms, during the test session.
